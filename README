This directory contains SVG versions of the ScummVM logo and icon. Also,
Photoshop file with the ScummVM logo is provided.

[TODO: State who created the logo.]
[TODO: Create a version of the logo with the "s" as upper case?]

Smaller versions of the logo in .ico, .png and .xpm format are also
provided for convenience; these can be regenerated from the SVG versions
with the included Makefile.

The 'beamer' subdirectory contains a template for the LaTeX 'beamer'
class which can be used to produce cool-looking presentations related to
ScummVM. Kudos to Kostas Nakos for writing the initial version of this. 
Max Horn tweaked it a bit to allow displaying our logo on every slide.

[TODO: Turn the beamer slides into a template, plus an *english* :)
  example presentation.]
