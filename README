This directory contains the ScummVM logo and icon and related artwork.

The 'original' subdirectory contains the design files in Photoshop and
SVG versions.

Smaller versions of the icon in .ico, .png and .xpm format are also
provided for convenience; these can be regenerated from the SVG versions
with the included Makefile.

The 'beamer' subdirectory contains a template for the LaTeX 'beamer'
class which can be used to produce cool-looking presentations related to
ScummVM. Kudos to Kostas Nakos for writing the initial version of this. 
Max Horn tweaked it a bit to allow displaying our logo on every slide.

The 'derivate' subdirectory contains media where the plain logo and icon
are combined with other elements.

[TODO: Turn the beamer slides into a template, plus an *english* :)
  example presentation.]
[TODO: Update the "original" SVGs so we can automatically generate the
  .png from them]
